# NLP Basics: Stemming in NLTK

Today I got acquainted with the concept of **stemming**.

## What is Stemming?
Stemming is a method in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to reduce words to their base or root form.  
For example, the word **playing** can be reduced to **play**.  
I used the `PorterStemmer` class from the NLTK library to implement this.  
However, stemming is not perfect and sometimes returns incorrect or incomplete results.  
In my code, you can see that some words are correctly converted, while others may not be.

## Description of My Code

1. **Importing the necessary module:**  
   I imported `PorterStemmer` from the `nltk.stem` module.

2. **Creating an object:**  
   I created an instance of the `PorterStemmer` class and named it `stemmer`.  
   This object allows me to use the `stem()` method for stemming words.

3. **Defining words:**  
   I manually created a list of words named `words` that I wanted to stem.

4. **Applying stemming:**  
   I defined `stemmed_words`, which stores the stemmed version of each word from the `words` list.

5. **Printing the results:**  
   Finally, I printed both the original and the stemmed lists to compare the results.
